# üß± Nexel Hardware Sales Insight Dashboard
# Project Overview
Nexel Hardware, a traditional hardware retailer, faced challenges in tracking and understanding its sales performance. The absence of clear visibility into sales data limited the company‚Äôs ability to recognize trends, forecast demand, optimize inventory, and plan marketing initiatives effectively.
To bridge this gap, the project aimed to design a data-driven analytical system that visualizes sales performance and profitability through interactive Power BI dashboards connected to an SQL database. This solution empowers Nexel Hardware to make informed decisions, uncover growth opportunities, and enhance overall business efficiency.
